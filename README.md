# Heavy Machinery Company Sales Report

Welcome to the Heavy Machinery Company Sales Report Generator repository. This README provides an overview of the Python program that simulates a company selling heavy machinery to construction companies. The program generates a year of sales data in CSV format and then creates an HTML sales report with visualizations based on the CSV data.

## Overview

The Heavy Machinery Company Sales Report is a Python-based program that demonstrates how sales data can be managed and visualized for a heavy machinery company. The program simulates a year's worth of sales, generating data such as product names, quantities, prices, and customer information.

## Features
In this python program I make use of python libraries such as pandas and plotly

### Data Generation

The data generation program creates a CSV file containing sales data for heavy machinery products. It simulates transactions with varying quantities, prices, and customer details. The generated CSV file serves as the input for the sales report visualization.

### Sales Report Visualization

This report visualization program reads the generated CSV file and generates an HTML sales report. This report includes interactive charts, graphs, and tables that provide insights into the sales performance. The visualizations help in understanding trends, popular products, and customer engagement.
